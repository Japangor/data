They retained only two players from last season, one of whom was their breakout star, Shashank Singh, who was their highest run-scorer in 2024. With a power-packed batting lineup featuring Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Shreyas Iyer, and Josh Inglis, PBKS have added serious firepower. Iyer, their newly appointed captain, will need to step up and lead from the front, especially since the team will look to him for stability in the middle order. However, it’s their bowling that has seen the most improvement. The addition of Yuzvendra Chahal and Marco Jansen alongside Arshdeep Singh, their highest wicket-taker of the last season, gives them a well-rounded attack. Chahal’s experience in middle overs and Jansen’s ability to strike with the new ball will be key for them. If Punjab’s big hitters fire, Gujarat’s bowlers will have their work cut out.","Timestamp":"2025-03-25T18:35:50+05:30","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":""},{"Over":"","Id":"3","UID":10003,"OID":10003.0,"Runs":"","ZAD":"","Detail":"","Isball":false,"Bowler":"","Bowler_Name":"","Bowler_Short_Name":"","Batsman":"","Batsman_Name":"","Batsman_Short_Name":"","Commentary":"The Gujarat Titans will be relying heavily on their captain, Shubman Gill, to lead from the front with the bat. His form at the top will be crucial, especially since the middle order still has some question marks. The addition of Jos Buttler is a massive boost for them, providing experience and explosiveness alongside Gill at the top. Sai Sudharsan, their highest run-scorer last season, will once again be a key figure, holding the innings together. However, their middle order lacks the firepower they once had with David Miller, putting extra responsibility on Rahul Tewatia to be their finisher. The biggest improvement, though, has come in their bowling attack. Rashid Khan remains their X-factor, but the inclusion of Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Siraj, and Prasidh Krishna gives them one of the most fearsome pace attacks in the tournament. If they can click as a unit, Gujarat’s bowling could be a nightmare for any opposition.","Timestamp":"2025-03-25T18:33:45+05:30","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":""},{"Over":"","Id":"2","UID":10002,"OID":10002.0,"Runs":"","ZAD":"","Detail":"","Isball":false,"Bowler":"","Bowler_Name":"","Bowler_Short_Name":"","Batsman":"","Batsman_Name":"","Batsman_Short_Name":"","Commentary":"Hello and welcome to the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, where the Gujarat Titans take on the Punjab Kings in the 5th match of IPL 2025!

Gujarat Titans (GT) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) are ready to ignite the tournament with a blockbuster clash at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium. GT, under the leadership of Shubman Gill, are determined to erase the memories of their underwhelming 2024 season, and with the lethal opening duo of Gill and Jos Buttler, they have firepower to set the game ablaze. The ever-reliable Rashid Khan remains their biggest X-factor with the ball, and the addition of Kagiso Rabada further bolsters their arsenal. With him playing against his former team adds a bit of more spice to this match. But PBKS, led by their new skipper Shreyas Iyer who led the Kolkata Knight Riders to the title last season, and guided by the tactical brilliance of Ricky Ponting, are out to shatter their playoff curse. Their lineup is stacked with explosive hitters like Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis, while the pace battery, spearheaded by Arshdeep Singh and Marco Jansen, is ready to unleash fury. The all- round brilliance of Azmatullah Omarzai who has taken the world by storm in recent times will be a key factor for them. And let’s not forget their game-changing acquisition - Yuzvendra Chahal, one of the finest leg-spinners in IPL history, who could be the difference-maker in crunch moments. While GT have dominated the head-to-head battle, winning two of their last three encounters, PBKS are hungrier than ever, bringing a fearless, no-holds-barred attitude to the fight. GT’s balance gives them the edge, but their middle-order vulnerability and pace concerns could be their Achilles’ heel, while PBKS must overcome their historic inconsistency and shaky death bowling. With both teams craving a statement win, this showdown promises fireworks, drama, and pure cricketing chaos. The big question remains - whose side are you on?","Timestamp":"2025-03-24T05:08:08+05:30","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":""}],"InningNo":"1","BattingTeam_Id":"1107","BattingTeam":"Punjab Kings","BowlingTeam_Id":"2955","BowlingTeam":"Gujarat Titans","GameCode":"ahmkp03252025253703","MatchId":"253703","Timestamp":"03/25/2025T22:57:48+05:30","Deleted_UID":[],"Equation":"Gujarat Titans need 244 runs in 120 balls at 12.2 rpo","Series_Status":""}
