Another review. This time, by Sherfane Rutherford for a no ball not given for height. Going across the left-hander, waist-high full toss, Rutherford is beaten for pace as he swings at it. The tracker comes up and shows that it is a fair delivery with the ball below the waist. After all the drama we have had in this over, only 3 runs have come off it so far.","Timestamp":"2025-03-25T22:58:27+05:30","Non_Striker":"9782","Non_Striker_Name":"Jos Buttler","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"J Buttler","Score":"185/2","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"99","Over_No":"17","Ball":"6","Ball_Line_Length":"31,11,10,15","This_Over":"1(1WD),1(1WD),0,1(1WD),0,0,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"\",\"138.7\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"67285","Runs":"22","Balls":"16","Fours":"1","Sixes":"2"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"9782","Runs":"46","Balls":"28","Fours":"3","Sixes":"2"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"67628","Overs":"1.3","Maidens":"0","Runs":"8","Wickets":"0"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"16.3: Vyshak Vijaykumar to Sherfane Rutherford, No run."},{"Over":"16.2","Id":"114","UID":20114,"OID":20114.0,"Runs":"0","ZAD":"","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"67628","Bowler_Name":"Vyshak Vijaykumar","Bowler_Short_Name":"V Vijaykumar","Batsman":"67285","Batsman_Name":"Sherfane Rutherford","Batsman_Short_Name":"S Rutherford","Batsman_Style":"L","Commentary":"Sneaks just inside the wide tramline, low full toss, Sherfane Rutherford tries to smash it away on the off side but misses.","Timestamp":"2025-03-25T22:56:26+05:30","Non_Striker":"9782","Non_Striker_Name":"Jos Buttler","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"J Buttler","Score":"185/2","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"98","Over_No":"17","Ball":"5","Ball_Line_Length":"32,6,12,18","This_Over":"1(1WD),1(1WD),0,1(1WD),0,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"\",\"138.7\",\"\",\"\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"67285","Runs":"22","Balls":"15","Fours":"1","Sixes":"2"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"9782","Runs":"46","Balls":"28","Fours":"3","Sixes":"2"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"67628","Overs":"1.2","Maidens":"0","Runs":"8","Wickets":"0"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"16.2: Vyshak Vijaykumar to Sherfane Rutherford, No run."},{"Over":"16.2","Id":"113","UID":20113,"OID":20113.0,"Runs":"1","ZAD":"","Detail":"wd","Isball":true,"Bowler":"67628","Bowler_Name":"Vyshak Vijaykumar","Bowler_Short_Name":"V Vijaykumar","Batsman":"67285","Batsman_Name":"Sherfane Rutherford","Batsman_Short_Name":"S Rutherford","Batsman_Style":"L","Commentary":"Wide!
