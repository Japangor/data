On being asked about the feelings in the RCB dugout during the last over of the chase, Karthik honestly says that the last few deliveries took a humongous effort to stop CSK scoring and praises Yash Dayal for doing really well and adds that these things really uplift the mood in the camp. On the chat during the second Strategic timeout when RCB were batting, Dinesh says that they had a few good batters - Jitesh Sharma, Tim David and Romario Shepherd - so they wanted to maximize their potential but admits that it was hard to start on. So, he adviced the batters take it easy on the first couple of balls but once you get set, hit strong shots. On Dayal, DK calls him one with a strong ethic - someone who works really hard in practice and in terms of effort, ranking him right up there with the greats. Agrees that the execution might go up and down but details that one of the reasons RCB retained him was because of the way he won games for them in the last year, reflecting on that win against CSK in Bengaluru in 2024 at this same venue. On Suyash Sharma, Dinesh Karthik says that Suyash likes to deliver under pressure. Adds that Suyash may not be in the list of the top spinners in the country but he is a great bowler and someone who could be a great asset to the Indian spin department. Details that because of his efforts, Krunal Pandya has been able to bowl well this season.","Timestamp":"2025-05-04T00:18:35+05:30","Non_Striker":"","Non_Striker_Name":"","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"","Score":"","Batsman_Runs":"","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"","Over_No":"","Ball":"","Ball_Line_Length":"","This_Over":"","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"","Created_Timestamp":"2025-05-03T23:51:56+05:30"},{"Over":"","Id":"156","UID":20156,"OID":20156.0,"Runs":"","ZAD":"","Detail":"","Isball":false,"Bowler":"","Bowler_Name":"","Bowler_Short_Name":"","Batsman":"","Batsman_Name":"","Batsman_Short_Name":"","Batsman_Style":"","Commentary":"MS Dhoni, the captain of Chennai Super Kings, reflects that he should have converted some deliveries into big shots and humbly takes the blame onto him.

Boy, is Shepherd getting a taste of his own medicine? 100 UP FOR CSK and what a way to bring it up! A length ball, around off, Ayush Mhatre picks it up in a trice and swings it cleanly and mammothly over mid-wicket! Moves to 62 (28), with his 4th six. This stand is now worth 43 (24).","Timestamp":"2025-05-03T22:15:11+05:30","Non_Striker":"3850","Non_Striker_Name":"Ravindra Jadeja","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Jadeja","Score":"101/2","Batsman_Runs":"6","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"6","Ball_Speed":"130.9kph","Ball_Number":"58","Over_No":"10","Ball":"4","Ball_Line_Length":"18,13,9,12,54,11","This_Over":"1,6,0,6,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"136.1\",\"106.4\",\"139.9\",\"130.9\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"120157","Runs":"62","Balls":"28","Fours":"7","Sixes":"4"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"3850","Runs":"20","Balls":"14","Fours":"3","Sixes":"0"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"66243","Overs":"0.4","Maidens":"0","Runs":"13","Wickets":"0"},"Milestone":[{"Event_Type_Id":1,"Team_Id":1108,"Event_Id":1,"Event":"100 Runs"}],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"9.4: Romario Shepherd to Ayush Mhatre, Six!"},{"Over":"9.3","Id":"66","UID":20066,"OID":20066.0,"Runs":"0","ZAD":"5,192,3","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"66243","Bowler_Name":"Romario Shepherd","Bowler_Short_Name":"R Shepherd","Batsman":"120157","Batsman_Name":"Ayush Mhatre","Batsman_Short_Name":"A Mhatre","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Slower ball, on a length, around off, Mhatre defends it towards cover.","Timestamp":"2025-05-03T22:14:16+05:30","Non_Striker":"3850","Non_Striker_Name":"Ravindra Jadeja","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Jadeja","Score":"95/2","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Ball_Speed":"139.9kph","Ball_Number":"57","Over_No":"10","Ball":"3","Ball_Line_Length":"19,5,10,8,42,15","This_Over":"1,6,0,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"136.1\",\"106.4\",\"139.9\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"120157","Runs":"56","Balls":"27","Fours":"7","Sixes":"3"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"3850","Runs":"20","Balls":"14","Fours":"3","Sixes":"0"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"66243","Overs":"0.3","Maidens":"0","Runs":"7","Wickets":"0"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"9.3: Romario Shepherd to Ayush Mhatre, No run."},{"Over":"9.2","Id":"65","UID":20065,"OID":20065.0,"Isboundary":true,"Runs":"6","ZAD":"2,63,5","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"66243","Bowler_Name":"Romario Shepherd","Bowler_Short_Name":"R Shepherd","Batsman":"120157","Batsman_Name":"Ayush Mhatre","Batsman_Short_Name":"A Mhatre","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"SIX!
