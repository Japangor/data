With one of the worst batting averages in the Powerplay this season, averaging just 7.91 in the field restrictions, they will need a strong start from the openers. But they will be up against a quality RCB bowling unit.

On Romario Shepherd's knock, Bethell says that it was incredible to watch. Adds that he doesn't think that he middled all his shots but it didn't seem like that. On his opening partnership with Virat Kohli, Jacob says that the duo made sure that it kept hitting everything down the ground. Informs that the feedback from Virat Kohli on the pitch was that there was not much bounce and to try and get on top of the new ball. On batting against the new ball, JB says that there wasn't much swing early on and that made batting easier. Adds that he loved hitting the ball through the covers. On the experience to be playing alongside Kohli, Jacob Bethell says that it was pretty cool to be with him in Delhi and even more so tonight, as he got to spend some more time in the middle with the legend. On RCB's score, Bethell says that the team wanted 210, so they are happy that they got that. Informs that there was some spin in the middle overs, so expects RCB's spinners to extract spin as well.

This one called by the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. This has been a trend this season, with the batting side opting to call for the timeout around the 13th or the 14th over, treating the last 5-6 overs like another Powerplay. It has been a tough outing for Chennai Super Kings so far, with only 6 overs out of 13 going in single digits. Nearly everyone has travelled, with a slight exception in Anshul Kamboj and Ravindra Jadeja. Of course, Pathirana has bowled just 1 over. With a big batting lineup, the hosts seem poised to get to 220, but given that Pathirana has taken a wicket in his opening over, could tonight be the night where his fortunes change? Also, with two new batters in the middle, there could be a slight loss in momentum for the home side.","Timestamp":"2025-05-03T20:34:01+05:30","Non_Striker":"","Non_Striker_Name":"","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"","Score":"","Batsman_Runs":"","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"","Over_No":"","Ball":"","Ball_Line_Length":"","This_Over":"","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":""},{"Over":"12.6","Id":"110","UID":10110,"OID":10110.0,"Runs":"0","ZAD":"5,198,3","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"71411","Bowler_Name":"Noor Ahmad","Bowler_Short_Name":"N Ahmad","Batsman":"65687","Batsman_Name":"Rajat Patidar","Batsman_Short_Name":"R Patidar","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Three dots on the trot to close out the over!

There was some swing, but it quickly disappeared after the opening over. If any, there is some extra bounce if you bend your back, but haven't seen much instances of that so far. The readers of the pitch predicted that there would be spin on offer, and Jadeja extracted plenty of bounce in the previous over. Would be interesting to see how do these middle overs go by.

As Royal Challengers Bengaluru host Chennai Super Kings in Match 52, we're set for another thrilling chapter in the Virat Kohli-MS Dhoni saga, a rivalry that continues to captivate cricket lovers everywhere. When these giants first clashed this season, both teams were riding the high of opening victories. Since then? It's been a tale of dramatically different journeys. RCB stunned Chennai at their fortress Chepauk, but what followed was a frustrating pattern of inconsistency – win, loss, win, loss – a rollercoaster that kept them from building momentum despite flashes of brilliance. But just when critics wondered if they'd ever find consistency, RCB has exploded with three consecutive victories, propelling them into serious playoff contention with a real shot at the coveted top-two finish. Their dominant run now has them perched in the upper echelons of the table, showcasing the kind of form that makes opposition teams nervous. Virat Kohli has been the batting linchpin, crafting six masterful half-centuries and standing tall as the only RCB batter to cross the 400-run milestone. His consistency has him rubbing shoulders with the season's elite run-scorers. The numbers tell a revealing story – beyond Kohli, Phil Salt and Devdutt Padikkal haven't even reached 300 runs, yet RCB keeps winning. Their recipe? A top-order that absorbs pressure, Tim David's brute finishing blows, and Krunal Pandya's clutch all-round performances that repeatedly tip the scales. But RCB's true transformation this season lies in their bowling attack. The international pace duo of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood has intimidated the batting orders, helping claim the second-most powerplay wickets in the tournament. Hazlewood's brilliance has earned him the prestigious Purple Cap. When batters dare to breathe easier against pace, the spin tandem of Krunal and Suyash Sharma springs the trap, creating a bowling unit with seemingly no weak links to exploit. Across the field, Chennai Super Kings find themselves in unfamiliar and uncomfortable territory. With a dismal record of eight defeats and just a couple of wins, they're one of just two teams already mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, marking only the second time in IPL history they've missed consecutive playoffs. Their maximum possible points tally of 12 falls well short of the qualification threshold, making this one of the earliest exits since Pune Warriors India's 2013 campaign. CSK's struggles begin in the powerplay, where they average a tournament-worst 7.91 runs while losing more wickets than any rival – a fatal combination that has repeatedly extinguished momentum before it could build. The batting unit has lacked both consistency and intent, with even MS Dhoni's usually reliable finishing touches failing to spark conviction. Yet even in this challenging season, CSK shows glimpses of their strategic vision. Young talents Shaik Rasheed and Ayush Mhatre are getting valuable exposure, while Dewald Brevis has brought much-needed boundary-clearing explosiveness. The bowling offers some consolation as Khaleel Ahmed strikes consistently with the new ball, while Noor Ahmad's wizardry has him among the tournament's top five wicket-takers. However, it's important to finish and bowl well in the death overs, which isn't coming for them. Their reliance on Matheesha Pathirana for the death bowling has proved too costly as the Sri Lankan slingy seamer has leaked runs at a worrisome economy rate. This is also one of the many reasons why they have lost games while doing both, defending and chasing. What makes this contest particularly intriguing is RCB's puzzling home record, with just one win against four losses at the usually formidable Chinnaswamy Stadium. Can they overcome this strange home disadvantage against a wounded CSK side with nothing to lose but pride? When these cricket royalties clash under Bengaluru's lights, expect nothing less than a spectacle where a vision for the future meets determination. Will RCB continue their march toward glory, or will Dhoni's men remind everyone why, even in defeat, champions never truly lose their roar? But, forecasts predict that this generational clash might get rain interruptions as the weather in Bengaluru has been a bit overcast over a couple of days. But, hopes are of a complete game of cricket.
