The UltraEdge shows a spike as the ball passes the bat, and the on-field call of NOT OUT is overturned to OUT.","Iswicket":true,"Dismissed":"63788","Timestamp":"2025-04-18T22:21:27+05:30","Non_Striker":"65687","Non_Striker_Name":"Rajat Patidar","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Patidar","Score":"33/5","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Dismissal_Type":"caught & bowled","Dismissal_Id":"cbb","Ball_Speed":"132.1kph","Howout":"c & b Marco Jansen","Fielders":[{"Player_Id":69409,"Player_Name":"Marco Jansen"}],"Ball_Number":"37","Over_No":"7","Ball":"1","Ball_Line_Length":"20,23,28,22,55,23","This_Over":"0(W),","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"132.1\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"63788","Runs":"1","Balls":"2","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"65687","Runs":"21","Balls":"15","Fours":"1","Sixes":"1"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"69409","Overs":"1.1","Maidens":"0","Runs":"3","Wickets":"1"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"6.1: Marco Jansen to Krunal Pandya, No run."},{"Over":"5.6","Id":"65","UID":10065,"OID":10065.0,"Runs":"1","ZAD":"8,349,4","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"9844","Bowler_Name":"Yuzvendra Chahal","Bowler_Short_Name":"Y Chahal","Batsman":"63788","Batsman_Name":"Krunal Pandya","Batsman_Short_Name":"K Pandya","Batsman_Style":"L","Commentary":"Tossed up, fuller, on off, Krunal flicks it off the front foot to deep mid-wicket for a single.","Summary":{"Score":"33/4","Over":"6","Runs":"4","Wickets":"1","Batsmen":[{"Batsman":"63788","Isonstrike":true,"Runs":"1","Balls":"1","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},{"Batsman":"65687","Runs":"21","Balls":"15","Fours":"1","Sixes":"1"}],"Bowlers":[{"Bowler":"9844","Overs":"1","Maidens":"0","Runs":"4","Wickets":"1","Ball_bowled":"6","Dot_balls":"2"}],"Balls":"36","Current_runrate":"5.50"},"Timestamp":"2025-04-18T22:18:32+05:30","Non_Striker":"65687","Non_Striker_Name":"Rajat Patidar","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Patidar","Score":"33/4","Batsman_Runs":"1","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"1","Ball_Speed":"88.4kph","Ball_Number":"36","Over_No":"6","Ball":"6","Ball_Line_Length":"19,2,12,18,30,17","This_Over":"1,0,1,1,0(W),1,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"89.7\",\"89.5\",\"\",\"88.7\",\"88.9\",\"88.4\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"63788","Runs":"1","Balls":"1","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"65687","Runs":"21","Balls":"15","Fours":"1","Sixes":"1"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"9844","Overs":"1","Maidens":"0","Runs":"4","Wickets":"1"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"End_Over":true,"Default_Commentary":"5.6: Yuzvendra Chahal to Krunal Pandya, 1 run."},{"Over":"","Id":"64","UID":10064,"OID":10064.0,"Runs":"","ZAD":"","Detail":"","Isball":false,"Bowler":"","Bowler_Name":"","Bowler_Short_Name":"","Batsman":"","Batsman_Name":"","Batsman_Short_Name":"","Batsman_Style":"","Commentary":"Krunal Pandya walks in.","Timestamp":"2025-04-18T22:18:24+05:30","Non_Striker":"","Non_Striker_Name":"","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"","Score":"","Batsman_Runs":"","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"","Over_No":"","Ball":"","Ball_Line_Length":"","This_Over":"","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":""},{"Over":"5.5","Id":"63","UID":10063,"OID":10063.0,"Runs":"0","ZAD":"1,13,4","Detail":"W","Isball":true,"Bowler":"9844","Bowler_Name":"Yuzvendra Chahal","Bowler_Short_Name":"Y Chahal","Batsman":"64724","Batsman_Name":"Jitesh Sharma","Batsman_Short_Name":"J Sharma","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"OUT!

Priyansh Arya calls for it, backtracks and takes a good catch.","Iswicket":true,"Dismissed":"63940","Summary":{"Score":"26/3","Over":"4","Runs":"5","Wickets":"1","Batsmen":[{"Batsman":"63940","Isonstrike":true,"Runs":"4","Balls":"6","Fours":"1","Sixes":"0"},{"Batsman":"65687","Runs":"17","Balls":"11","Fours":"1","Sixes":"1"}],"Bowlers":[{"Bowler":"66516","Overs":"2","Maidens":"0","Runs":"15","Wickets":"1","Ball_bowled":"12","Dot_balls":"7"}],"Balls":"24","Current_runrate":"6.50"},"Timestamp":"2025-04-18T22:09:05+05:30","Non_Striker":"65687","Non_Striker_Name":"Rajat Patidar","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Patidar","Score":"26/3","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Dismissal_Type":"caught","Dismissal_Id":"ct","Ball_Speed":"","Howout":"c Priyansh Arya b Xavier Bartlett","Fielders":[{"Player_Id":71366,"Player_Name":"Priyansh Arya"}],"Ball_Number":"24","Over_No":"4","Ball":"6","Ball_Line_Length":"16,3,9,25,31,12","This_Over":"0,1,0,4,0,0(W),","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"135.1\",\"131.9\",\"129.2\",\"133.1\",\"\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"63940","Runs":"4","Balls":"6","Fours":"1","Sixes":"0"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"65687","Runs":"17","Balls":"11","Fours":"1","Sixes":"1"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"66516","Overs":"2","Maidens":"0","Runs":"15","Wickets":"1"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"End_Over":true,"Default_Commentary":"3.6: Xavier Bartlett to Liam Livingstone, OUT! c Priyansh Arya b Xavier Bartlett."},{"Over":"3.5","Id":"50","UID":10050,"OID":10050.0,"Runs":"0","ZAD":"3,130,3","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"66516","Bowler_Name":"Xavier Bartlett","Bowler_Short_Name":"X Bartlett","Batsman":"63940","Batsman_Name":"Liam Livingstone","Batsman_Short_Name":"L Livingstone","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Back of a length, over off, Liam Livingstone dabs it to point.","Timestamp":"2025-04-18T22:07:25+05:30","Non_Striker":"65687","Non_Striker_Name":"Rajat Patidar","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Patidar","Score":"26/2","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"23","Over_No":"4","Ball":"5","Ball_Line_Length":"16,12,10,23,44,12","This_Over":"0,1,0,4,0,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"135.1\",\"131.9\",\"129.2\",\"133.1\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"63940","Runs":"4","Balls":"5","Fours":"1","Sixes":"0"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"65687","Runs":"17","Balls":"11","Fours":"1","Sixes":"1"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"66516","Overs":"1.5","Maidens":"0","Runs":"15","Wickets":"0"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"3.5: Xavier Bartlett to Liam Livingstone, No run."},{"Over":"3.4","Id":"49","UID":10049,"OID":10049.0,"Isboundary":true,"Runs":"4","ZAD":"4,168,5","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"66516","Bowler_Name":"Xavier Bartlett","Bowler_Short_Name":"X Bartlett","Batsman":"63940","Batsman_Name":"Liam Livingstone","Batsman_Short_Name":"L Livingstone","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"FOUR!

While most bowlers have found it tough going here, Chahal has thrived, making this ground a personal hunting ground. Then there’s Glenn Maxwell, who’s had a couple of really strong seasons at this very venue. With his explosive batting and game-changing flair, this could be the perfect stage for him to rediscover his rhythm and get back to form.

Preview - As the midpoint approaches, things are really heating up now in this 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League. It has served entertainment aplenty with bone-chilling moments in the last week. We have seen a mammoth total of 246 being chased down, while also witnessed a below run-a-ball total of 111 being defended. Breaking all the mathematical barriers, Match number 34 is expected to be another thriller as the high-flying Royal Challengers Bengaluru welcome a rejuvenated Punjab Kings outfit to their fortress at Chinnaswamy. It promises another thriller in a season that's already shattered expectations and statistical logic. RCB, perched impressively at third on the table, enter with their recent form reading like binary code - loss, win, loss, win in their last four outings. Fresh from dismantling Rajasthan Royals, they'll be desperate to break this alternating pattern and cement their top-four credentials as the table compresses with every passing game. RCB’s batting arsenal has been in a fine form with Phil Salt providing the early fireworks while run-machine Virat Kohli continues his golden touch with three half-centuries already, keeping him firmly in the Orange Cap race. First-time skipper Rajat Patidar has led from the front, combining fearless leadership with explosive batting contributions, including two fifties of his own. RCB's middle order strength has masked Padikkal's struggles, with the batter desperately seeking form after being given a long rope to prove himself. The bowling department has found its rhythm with overseas star Josh Hazlewood breaking into the top wicket-takers list, well supported by the experienced Bhuvneshwar Kumar and ably backed by Yash Dayal, forming a threatening pace trio. Despite pre-season skepticism surrounding their spin options, Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma have risen to the challenge admirably, delivering clutch performances in pressure situations and proving the doubters wrong. If there's one team that embodies the wild, unpredictable spirit of T20 cricket, it's Punjab Kings. Just days after their bowlers were obliterated in a record-breaking chase, where they failed to defend a mammoth total of 245, they turned the script on its head by pulling off a miraculous defense of 111. Only possible in the IPL, right? Openers Prabhsimran Singh and the young sensation Priyansh Arya have been providing the fireworks upfront, but the middle order remains a puzzle. Captain Shreyas Iyer's form is a tale of two extremes. On the road, he’s been a run-glutton scoring 97, 52, 82, respectively, but at home, he’s managed a paltry 19 runs in three innings, including a duck. Meanwhile, Glenn Maxwell's prolonged slump is bordering on bizarre. As across the last two IPL seasons, he hasn’t even crossed 100 runs total. Though Big Show’s handy off-breaks have offered some consolation. The silver lining? Yuzvendra Chahal's resurgence. After a lukewarm start, the wily leg-spinner roared back with a match-defining 4/28, reminding everyone why he’s still among the best in the business. Pace-wise, Arshdeep Singh has been the consistent performer with him finding decent support from his other pace colleagues. Both teams are so closely contested which also reflects in their head to head stats as PBKS enjoy a minimal 17-16 lead over RCB. However, RCB can take inspiration from their recent performance as they haven’t lost against Punjab Kings since 2022, with a 3-0 record at their home ground against this opposition in their last three meets here. With everything to play for and only net run rate separating these sides on the table, cricket fans should brace themselves for another high-octane clash.","Timestamp":"2025-04-18T19:40:30+05:30","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"","Created_Timestamp":"2025-02-16T18:41:29+05:30"}],"InningNo":"1","BattingTeam_Id":"1105","BattingTeam":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru","BowlingTeam_Id":"1107","BowlingTeam":"Punjab Kings","GameCode":"bckp04182025257248","MatchId":"257248","Timestamp":"04/19/2025T00:03:00+05:30","Deleted_UID":[],"Equation":"Punjab Kings need 96 runs in 84 balls at 6.85 rpo","Series_Status":""}
