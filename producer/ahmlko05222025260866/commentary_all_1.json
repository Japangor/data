A tough chance, but a chance nevertheless! Short of a good length, just outside off, Mitchell Marsh finds the ball a bit too high due to extra bounce and flat bats it off the toe end of the bat. It goes flat and straight back to the bowler. Mohammed Siraj attempts for the return catch, but couldn't cling on it. The ball rolls to the mid on region but they don't cross over.","Timestamp":"2025-05-22T19:53:18+05:30","Non_Striker":"64219","Non_Striker_Name":"Aiden Markram","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"A Markram","Score":"25/0","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Ball_Speed":"141.1kph","Ball_Number":"16","Over_No":"3","Ball":"4","Ball_Line_Length":"16,15,12,11,52,11","This_Over":"2,1,0,0,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"140.7\",\"\",\"139.5\",\"141.1\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"10094","Runs":"7","Balls":"7","Fours":"0","Sixes":"1"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"64219","Runs":"15","Balls":"9","Fours":"2","Sixes":"0"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"65799","Overs":"1.4","Maidens":"0","Runs":"11","Wickets":"0"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"2.4: Mohammed Siraj to Mitchell Marsh, No run.","type_id":0},{"Over":"2.3","Id":"37","UID":10037,"OID":10037.0,"Runs":"0","ZAD":"","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"65799","Bowler_Name":"Mohammed Siraj","Bowler_Short_Name":"M Siraj","Batsman":"10094","Batsman_Name":"Mitchell Marsh","Batsman_Short_Name":"M Marsh","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Swing and a miss!

It will be a clash between two sides on divergent paths, with Gujarat eyeing a top-two finish while Lucknow, after their recent defeat, are officially out of playoff contention. The Titans currently sit comfortably atop the table with 18 points from 12 games. Two more wins would guarantee them a top-two spot, although even a single win could be enough if Punjab fail to win both of their remaining fixtures. GT’s success this season has been built around the brilliance of their top order, particularly the consistently outstanding Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill, with Jos Buttler chipping in as well. With the ball, Prasidh Krishna has been the spearhead, ably supported by Sai Kishore and Mohammed Siraj. What makes Gujarat's dominance even more impressive is that it has come despite Rashid Khan not hitting his usual heights and Kagiso Rabada being largely unavailable due to a provisional drug suspension. As for the Lucknow Super Giants, they are set to miss the playoffs for a second consecutive year. With pride on the line, they will now aim to disrupt GT’s top-two aspirations and those of RCB in their remaining fixtures. While Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram have offered solid starts, the middle order has failed to capitalise. Nicholas Pooran, after a bright start to the season, has faded, while captain and marquee signing Rishabh Pant has struggled to make any real impact. Lucknow’s bowling unit has lacked experience, and injuries have only compounded their problems. To make matters worse, they will be without Digvesh Singh for this match, who serves a one-game suspension following a third Code of Conduct breach. Still, the likes of Akash Deep, Will O'Rourke, and Avesh Khan will aim to test the in-form GT top order, while Ravi Bishnoi, despite a quiet season, remains a potential threat. Earlier in the season, LSG got the better of GT in Lucknow, but Ahmedabad has been a fortress for Gujarat, with the Titans winning their last four games at home. Can they make it five in a row and edge closer to a top-two finish? We shall find out.","Timestamp":"2025-05-21T11:14:19+05:30","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"","type_id":0}],"InningNo":"1","BattingTeam_Id":"2954","BattingTeam":"Lucknow Super Giants","BowlingTeam_Id":"2955","BowlingTeam":"Gujarat Titans","GameCode":"ahmlko05222025260866","MatchId":"260866","Timestamp":"05/22/2025T21:47:48+05:30","Deleted_UID":[],"Equation":"Gujarat Titans need 236 runs in 120 balls at 11.8 rpo","Series_Status":""}
