IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Shahrukh Khan departs now and this is superb death over bowling from Avesh Khan! Goes for the yorker, does Avesh, but ends up bowling an in-dipping low full toss, on the stumps. Shahrukh Khan tries to hit it over the infield on the leg side, but loses his balance and ends up slicing it over cover. Ravi Bishnoi, the substitute fielder, takes a fine catch, running to his left.","Iswicket":true,"Dismissed":"64721","Timestamp":"2025-05-22T23:35:46+05:30","Non_Striker":"65748","Non_Striker_Name":"Rashid Khan","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Khan","Score":"197/7","Batsman_Runs":"0","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","Dismissal_Type":"caught","Dismissal_Id":"ct","Ball_Speed":"","Howout":"c sub Ravi Bishnoi b Avesh Khan","Fielders":[{"Player_Id":71288,"Player_Name":"Ravi Bishnoi","Is_Sub":true}],"Ball_Number":"113","Over_No":"19","Ball":"5","Ball_Line_Length":"19,2,12,20","This_Over":"1,1,1,1,0(W),","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"138.0\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"64721","Runs":"57","Balls":"29","Fours":"5","Sixes":"3"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"65748","Runs":"2","Balls":"2","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"64511","Overs":"3.4","Maidens":"0","Runs":"50","Wickets":"2"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"18.5: Avesh Khan to Shahrukh Khan, OUT! c sub Ravi Bishnoi b Avesh Khan.","type_id":0},{"Over":"18.4","Id":"136","UID":20136,"OID":20136.0,"Runs":"1","ZAD":"8,341,4","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"64511","Bowler_Name":"Avesh Khan","Bowler_Short_Name":"A Khan","Batsman":"65748","Batsman_Name":"Rashid Khan","Batsman_Short_Name":"R Khan","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Another full ball, almost a yorker at the stumps, Rashid Khan swings across the line, off the inside half of the bat, and gets a single to deep mid-wicket.","Timestamp":"2025-05-22T23:34:40+05:30","Non_Striker":"64721","Non_Striker_Name":"Shahrukh Khan","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"S Khan","Score":"197/6","Batsman_Runs":"1","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"1","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"112","Over_No":"19","Ball":"4","Ball_Line_Length":"18,3,10,16","This_Over":"1,1,1,1,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"138.0\",\"\",\"\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"65748","Runs":"2","Balls":"2","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"64721","Runs":"57","Balls":"28","Fours":"5","Sixes":"3"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"64511","Overs":"3.3","Maidens":"0","Runs":"50","Wickets":"1"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"18.4: Avesh Khan to Rashid Khan, 1 run.","type_id":0},{"Over":"18.3","Id":"135","UID":20135,"OID":20135.0,"Runs":"1","ZAD":"6,252,4","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"64511","Bowler_Name":"Avesh Khan","Bowler_Short_Name":"A Khan","Batsman":"64721","Batsman_Name":"Shahrukh Khan","Batsman_Short_Name":"S Khan","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"A yorker, around off, smashed down to long off for a single only.","Timestamp":"2025-05-22T23:33:40+05:30","Non_Striker":"65748","Non_Striker_Name":"Rashid Khan","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"R Khan","Score":"196/6","Batsman_Runs":"1","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"1","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"111","Over_No":"19","Ball":"3","Ball_Line_Length":"17,4,9,23,35,14","This_Over":"1,1,1,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"138.0\",\"\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"64721","Runs":"57","Balls":"28","Fours":"5","Sixes":"3"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"65748","Runs":"1","Balls":"1","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"64511","Overs":"3.2","Maidens":"0","Runs":"49","Wickets":"1"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"18.3: Avesh Khan to Shahrukh Khan, 1 run.","type_id":0},{"Over":"18.2","Id":"134","UID":20134,"OID":20134.0,"Runs":"1","ZAD":"4,163,3","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"64511","Bowler_Name":"Avesh Khan","Bowler_Short_Name":"A Khan","Batsman":"65748","Batsman_Name":"Rashid Khan","Batsman_Short_Name":"R Khan","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Gets the yorker right on money this time, this is squeezed through point for a single by Rashid.","Timestamp":"2025-05-22T23:33:05+05:30","Non_Striker":"64721","Non_Striker_Name":"Shahrukh Khan","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"S Khan","Score":"195/6","Batsman_Runs":"1","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"1","Ball_Speed":"","Ball_Number":"110","Over_No":"19","Ball":"2","Ball_Line_Length":"17,3,10,19,17,13","This_Over":"1,1,","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"138.0\",\"\"","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"65748","Runs":"1","Balls":"1","Fours":"0","Sixes":"0"},"Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"64721","Runs":"56","Balls":"27","Fours":"5","Sixes":"3"},"Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"64511","Overs":"3.1","Maidens":"0","Runs":"48","Wickets":"1"},"Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":"18.2: Avesh Khan to Rashid Khan, 1 run.","type_id":0},{"Over":"18.1","Id":"133","UID":20133,"OID":20133.0,"Runs":"1","ZAD":"7,295,4","Detail":"","Isball":true,"Bowler":"64511","Bowler_Name":"Avesh Khan","Bowler_Short_Name":"A Khan","Batsman":"64721","Batsman_Name":"Shahrukh Khan","Batsman_Short_Name":"S Khan","Batsman_Style":"R","Commentary":"Searches for the yorker, but spears out a low full toss.
