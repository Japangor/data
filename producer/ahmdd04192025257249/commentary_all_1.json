Match 35 brings us a mouth-watering clash as two of the top teams, Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals lock horns at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The stakes are high, the atmosphere promises to be electric, and both sides will be gunning for two vital points to solidify their position at the top. Gujarat Titans, after four commanding wins on the trot, faced a rare hiccup with a loss against LSG in their last outing. They’ll be desperate to bounce back and regain momentum. So far, GT has looked like a well-oiled unit, with most departments firing in unison. Their top order has been rock solid, with Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill consistently providing brisk starts, often setting the stage for the middle order to explode. Jos Buttler is in sublime touch, while Sherfane Rutherford’s role as an aggressor from ball one has perfectly complemented their approach, helping GT post formidable totals. On the bowling front, Mohammed Siraj has been lethal, spearheading the pace attack with early breakthroughs. Prasidh Krishna has supported brilliantly, and while GT have been strong, they’ll be hoping Rashid Khan finds his rhythm soon to truly become the invincible unit they’re aiming to be. On the other side, Delhi Capitals are flying high, having lost just one of their six games so far, and were the first team this season to reach 10 points. Their previous outing against Rajasthan Royals was a sensational thriller, with Mitchell Starc bowling a game-changing final over to force a Super Over, which DC went on to win. Despite the absence of Faf du Plessis at the top, Abishek Porel has stepped up, providing an explosive start. All eyes will again be on the promising Jake Fraser-McGurk, who’s yet to make a big mark this season. The inclusion of Karun Nair has added stability and depth, while KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs have anchored the middle order efficiently. In the bowling department, Starc has proven yet again why he’s considered a match-winner, while Vipraj Nigam has been the surprise package with his pinpoint bowling, stealing the spotlight. While DC's bowling hasn’t quite reached top gear yet, this could be the game where everything clicks, elevating them further in terms of dominance. With both teams packed with match-winners and in red-hot form, we’re all set for an absolute cracker. Strap in, this one promises to be a blockbuster.","Timestamp":"2025-04-18T14:10:08+05:30","Milestone":[],"Edited_Commentary":1,"Default_Commentary":""}],"InningNo":"1","BattingTeam_Id":"1109","BattingTeam":"Delhi Capitals","BowlingTeam_Id":"2955","BowlingTeam":"Gujarat Titans","GameCode":"ahmdd04192025257249","MatchId":"257249","Timestamp":"04/22/2025T15:12:32+05:30","Deleted_UID":[],"Equation":"Gujarat Titans need 204 runs in 120 balls at 10.2 rpo","Series_Status":""}
